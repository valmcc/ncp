# Accommodation

Eg. 

### Finding a room rental

University Malaya provides its own accommodation, but you’re not too keen on sleeping in a tiny room with another person and no air-con, I’d suggest finding a place elsewhere. You can find rooms on ibilik.my or get an AirBnB and try negotiating with the owner. 

As far as good places around university go, some options that are popular with other students include Pantai Hillpark, International House (really good) and the Saville residences. 

I stayed at Istara Condo which is right near an lrt stop two stations from university (I go lrt>bus>uni) which was very convenient to get around, however it is quite hard to find a room here due to heaps of demand from Brickfields Asia College which is just down the road from it.- _Valerian (Uni Malaya)_  



I stayed at International house and it was great!! Valerian didn't get a place as he was very disorganised, so get in quick!! -  _Susanna (Uni Malaya)_
